         And learn how to become the greatest slugslinger of all.
         his natural ability means Eli is the hottest new slugslinger in town.
         Eli Shane is generally an optimistic individual.
         As a teenager ofcourse.
         He likes to joke around.
         Eli is shown to treat them more as a family instead of his ammo as normal people do.
         His bond with his Slugs makes him refuse to trade them.
         In order to keep them close.
         As stated frequently throughout the show/slugisodes.
         Almost all Slugs like Eli.

        As well as enjoying to taunt the enemies.
        And/or trash talk his enemies.
        And he is shown a couple times at the Shane Gang's house to be playing video games.
        He appeared mysterious.
        And secretive about where he came from.
        He is also highly responsible.
        He is also highly mature.
        As he is able to care for himself at a young age.
        Eli considers the Shane Gang his family.
        And is willing to do anything to protect them.
        <br> <br>
        As a ten year old boy, Eli's hair was much shorter and his bangs hadn't grown yet. He had a baby face and was much shorter. He was briefly seen wearing a black rock star shirt and dark gray pants in The World Beneath Our Feet Part 1 and Part 2 Later on when he went to leave for Slugterra.

        But he opened up to the Shane Gang in A Distant Shore.
        Deciding that he wouldn't keep secrets from his "family" (the Shane Gang) anymore.
        Eli rarely thinks about money.
        And seems to have no interest on being rich.
        He seems to value his friendships with his friends and Slugs.
        He is shown multiple times hanging out with them and caring for each one of his team.
        When Twist  temporarily joined the Shane Gang, he was extremely distraught when he betrayed him.
        As he thought of Twist like a sibling.
        And only interacting with his father in "Return of the Elementals" Eli was particularly close to his father.
        And loved and looked up to him very much.

        More than money could ever give him.
This is shown multiple times throughout the show as well as being directly stated by Kord and Eli that he doesn't really care much for money.
        No matter how much was offered to him.
        He is one of the only people to name their Slugs as he gets them.
        Giving them each a unique nickname.
        Eli and his father promised each other that they would go down together to Slugterra.
        And start Slugsling together.
        <br> <br>
        But this promise was broken when Will Shane vanished.
        When eli was ten years old.
        He is shown to have a strong bond with his father.
He is also highly responsible and mature as he is able to care for himself at a young age without much guidance, but he still remains a reckless and adventurous teenager at heart. When Burpy had told him that his father had fallen, Eli didn't look too surprised.<strong> Wiki Fandom </strong>
