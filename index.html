    <h3>Eli Shane</h3>
    <p>
    <em>
    Eli Shane is the slugterra series protagonist.
    Eli Shane is the slugterra series main protagonist.
    And the current protector of the SlugTerra.
    Eli grew up on the surface.
    Always hoping of the day his father would take him down to Slugterra.
    Eli grew up on the surface.
    Always hoping of the day his father would take him down to Slugterra.
    To become The Shane <strong>(A slugslinging hero who protects this amazing underground world from bad guys)</strong>
    When his father goes missing, it's up to him to make the drop down to Slugterra.
    Alone on his 15th birthday.
    <br> <br>
    Eli is shown to treat them more as a family instead of his ammo as normal people do. His bond with his Slugs makes him refuse to trade them in order to keep them close. As stated frequently throughout the show/slugisodes, almost all Slugs generally like Eli.
    <br> <br>
    As a teenager, he likes to joke around as well as enjoying to taunt and/or trash talk his enemies, and he is shown a couple times at the Shane Gang's house to be playing video games. He appeared mysterious and secretive about where he came from, but he opened up to the Shane Gang in A Distant Shore deciding that he wouldn't keep secrets from his "family" (the Shane Gang) anymore.
    <br> <br>
    Eli rarely thinks about money and seems to have no interest on being rich, as opposed to Pronto. He seems to value his friendships with his friends and Slugs more than money could ever give him. This is shown multiple times throughout the show as well as being directly stated by Kord and Eli that he doesn't really care much for money, no matter how much was offered to him. He is one of the only people to name their Slugs as he gets them, giving them each a unique nickname.

    <em>
    Trixes full name is Beatrice Sting.
    She is no slouch on the Slugslinging field.
    She is a member of the Shane Gang.
    Trixie's shots are always a bulls eye.
    But when it comes to dueling she can also spot details.
    To help come up with a smart strategy for the team.
    Trixie is generally kind.
    And thoughtful person.
    Although she likes to keep an eye out for unusual Slugs.
    She always has her head in the game.
    And can often spot an exit or a come up with a new tactic when the team is caught up in the fight.
    She has a strong sense of justice, as Trixie says that she would try to keep the peace. This was largely in part due to the disappearance Of Will Shane, after which slingers came and terrorized her home cavern.
    Trixie decided to spread the news of what was happening in Slugterra, both good and bad.<strong>(Wiki Fandom)</strong>
