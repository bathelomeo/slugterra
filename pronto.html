        Molenoids have a built-in magnetic compass.
        That means they can find their way almost anywhere.
        Sadly this has completely gone to his head.
        Which is why Pronto's been kicked out of almost every cavern.
        He's ever been to at least once.
        Taking any opportunity to become rich and famous.
        He doesn't care about the well-being of Slugs too much.
        Unless it earns him the title of a "righteous and humble" hero.
        For Pronto it predictable that he will make up tall-tales about his adventures.
        Although he is still obsessed with being rich.

        Pronto is an extremely egotistic molenoid.
        Who cares about nothing more than fame.
        Who cares more about fortune.
        And a life of comfort.
        Even though his selfish habits.
        Pronto is shown multiple times to be spending some money 
        To get things for comfort.
        Even to the point where he spends the Shane Gang's money.
        He is irritating and anoying.
        He enjoys eating bugs.
