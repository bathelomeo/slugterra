        And upgrades their blasters.
        His favorite thing is to do is play practical jokes, usually on Pronto.
        He's pretty easy-going, and it's rare to see any anger or rage in Kord.
        This mountain of muscle has a big heart to match his giant biceps.
        Kord's got a wicked slinging arm.
        He loves making and upgrading machines so much.
        One time he locked himself in the Shane Gang's garage as he upgraded their Mechas.
        <br> <br>
        Even though he loves making and building machines.
        He still states that he'd like to be a Slugslinger.
        As opposed to being a full-time engineer like his other family members.
        As he is a cave troll, Kord is a bulky and muscular figure that can overpower even the most heaviest objects. <strong>Wiki Fandom</strong>

        He has a somewhat stubborn attitude, as he doesn't like to admit defeat when he can't fix something. He states that he rather eat a Toxin Slug than to admit that he can't fix something. Despite his stubbornness and his occasional anger issues, he is a gentle troll who loves helping others. He is also shown to love playing Video Games (with either Trixie or Eli) on his spare time, as well as playing and/or watching Slugball, his favourite sport. <strong>Wiki Fandom</strong>
