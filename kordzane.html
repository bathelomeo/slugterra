    As well as upgrading equipment.
    Most of which are the Shane Gang's equipment.
    He likes to boast about his abilities as an engineer.
    And a builder.
    And dislikes to admit defeat if he cannot fix something.

        And upgrades their blasters.
        His favorite thing is to do is play practical jokes, usually on Pronto.
        He's pretty easy-going, and it's rare to see any anger or rage in Kord.
        This mountain of muscle has a big heart to match his giant biceps.
        Kord's got a wicked slinging arm.
        He loves making and upgrading machines so much.
        One time he locked himself in the Shane Gang's garage as he upgraded their Mechas.
        Even though he loves making and building machines.
        He still states that he'd like to be a Slugslinger.
        As opposed to being a full-time engineer like his other family members.
