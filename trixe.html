         Trixes full name is Beatrice Sting.
         She is no slouch on the Slugslinging field.
         She is a member of the Shane Gang.
         Trixie's shots are always a bulls eye.
         But when it comes to dueling she can also spot details.
         She makes Slugisodes using her trusty camera.
         To teach people about Slugs.
         And how to care for them.
         As well as how to duel.
         Her dream is to make a documentary film about Slugs and their little society they have together.

        To help come up with a smart strategy for the team.
        Trixie is generally kind.
        And thoughtful person.
        Although she likes to keep an eye out for unusual Slugs.
        She always has her head in the game.
        Trixie is extremely loyal to the Shane Gang.
        And will help all of them while needed.
        Especially the leader, Eli Shane.
        <br> <br>
        Although he is keeping secrets from them.
        Trixie always manages to convince him to tell them their secrets as they are "family".
        Trixie is also seen to be slightly short-tempered, especially with Pronto. She also has a reckless attitude similar to Eli, but on a much smaller scale. Not much known is about her past, but she seemingly lived with parent(s).

        She has a strong sense of justice.
        As Trixie says that she would try to keep the peace.
        She has a strong bond with her slugs.
        And cares about them.
        Her signature or favourite slug is the tornado slug.
        She treats the Shane Gang as her family.

        This was largely in part due to the disappearance of Will Shane.
        After which slingers came and terrorized her home cavern.
        Trixie decided to spread the news of what was happening in Slugterra.
        Both good news and bad news.
        And she faithfully helps Eli gain acknowledgment as the new Shane.
        Especially with Pronto.
        She also has a reckless attitude similar to Eli.
        But on a much smaller scale.
        Not much known is about her past.
        But she seemingly lived with parents.
        <br> <br>
        As a young teenage girl, she has a skinny, slender build and is slightly shorter than your average person. She is seen to be fit and athletic, and much stronger than she appears. Trixie has fire-red hair that's tied up in two pigtails and long bangs that cover the right side of her face, as well as grassy green eyes.
